- <a href="https://yagolopez.github.io/material-light/iframe/iframe.html" target="_blank">For viewing from desktop PC</a>
- <a href="https://yagolopez.github.io/material-light/dist/" target="_blank">For viewing from mobile browser</a>

## Use

- Clone or download the repository.
- Copy the `ml` folder (where the components are) in your project and
  import `ml_module.ts` in your root module.
- Copy and paste the `assets` folder in the exact path in your project.
- Use the components following the examples in the `pages` directory. The components use `ml` as namespace. For example: `<ml-icon>email</ml-icon>`places an email icon component in a template.
- For **WEBPACK**: Load a demo using the angular-cli command`ng serve`. This should load `index.html` file at `localhost://4600`. (Webpack is used for compatibility with `angular-cli` projects)
- For **SYSTEMJS**: Load a demo pointing a web server to`index-systemjs.html`. (Systemjs is used as module loader during development)
