- <a href="https://yagolopez.github.io/material-light/dist/" target="_blank">Mobile (full screen)</a>

## Use

- Clone or download the repository.
- Copy the `ml` folder (where the components are) to your project and
  import `ml_module.ts` in your root module.
- Copy and paste the `assets` folder in the exact path in your project.
- Use the components following the examples in the `pages` directory. The components use `ml` as namespace. For example: `<ml-icon>email</ml-icon>`places an email icon component in a template.
- For **WEBPACK**: Load the demo using the angular-cli command`npm ng serve`. This should serve`index.html` at `localhost://4600`.
- For **SYSTEMJS**: Load the demo pointing a web server to`index-systemjs.html`. (Systemjs can be used as module loader during development instead of compile all files width Webpack)
