## Use

- This project is meant to be used with a angular-cli generated project
- Clone or download the repository.
- Copy the `ml` folder (where the components are) to your project
- Copy and paste the `assets` content in the exact same path in your project
- Use the components following the examples in the `pages` directory. The components use `ml` as namespace. For example: `<ml-icon>email</ml-icon>`places an email icon component in a template.
- If you are **not going** to use **lazy-loading modules**, import directily the components into your component. For example, if you are going to use a button with an icon you will need to import `MlButton` and `MlIcon` components.
- If you are **going** to use **lazy-loading modules**, in this case you will need to import the modules. For example, `MlButtonMod` and `MlIconMod`, following the before mentioned case.
